## Background:
It's hard to manage jumping between music stored on my phone and on my Spotify. I've set out to build a cross platform mobile application to automatically add my stored music to a Spotify playlist.

<b>This application is a work in progress.</b>

Note: This application is Android compatible with an iOS build coming soon.

## Requirements:
- Simple Permissions
